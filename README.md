# Full Stack Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Casting Agency Application

The Casting Agency is a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. This application allows users to interact with the database of actors and movies, in three different ways (depending on role permission level):

1. Casting Assistant: Can view actors and movies
2. Casting Director: Can view actors and movies, add or delete an actor from the database, and modify actors or movies
3. Executive Producer: As above, and can add or delete a movie from the database

## Using the application

The application is hosted on Heroku, at the address https://capstone-cameron-barker.herokuapp.com. Users can interact with the application using a tool such as cURL or Postman, and the below endpoints.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```js
{
    'success': false,
    'error': 404,
    'message': 'resource not found'
}
```
The API will return five error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad request
- 404: Resource not found
- 405: Method not allowed
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal server error

## Testing

The test scripts are stored in test_app.py, and use a connection to a local PostgreSQL database called agency_test, which can be populated using the test_database.psql file. To setup the database and perform the tests, run the following commands: 
```
dropdb agency_test
createdb agency_test
psql agency_test < test_database.psql
python test_app.py
```
